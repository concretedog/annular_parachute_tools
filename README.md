# annular_parachute_tools
a collection of tools for creating multi gore annular parachutes

The python script asks for a design diameter and a number of gore panels and will return all the values needed not only for the gore panel layout but also the lines and line insertion points. 

The FreeCAD project was made in version 1.0 and when opened you should find a gore panel sketch and a spreadsheet, in the spreadsheet you can set the desing diameter and the numebr of panels and it will update the sketch accordingly (as well as calculating all othe needed dimensions in the spreadsheet). If you then highlight the sketch in the tree view you can use _File - Export_ to then export a DXF or SVG file for laser cutting of gore panels etc.
